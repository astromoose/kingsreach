Sean\'s character. Elven Ranger.

Worsa\'s father, Willannan lives off the land surrounding Melchior. He
studies and learns from the land, currently enjoying the growing of
mushrooms and fauna as well as perfecting trapping methods for smaller
mammals. He is an expert in skinning and tanning. His mother, Iriediana
is a student of [Brilluthur Cadence](Brilluthur_Cadence "wikilink") - an
ancient elf and curator of demihuman lore in the Elder Library in
Melthrior.

Worsa\'s sadly deceased younger brother, Wenzer was named for his
great-great-great-grandfather - an elven hero spoken of in human legends
still today - the \'Quick Wenzer\'. Worsa was named for his
great-great-great-great-grandfather, whose name is written on family
trees unearthed only by Iriediana.

Wenzer was killed by goblins while Willannan was taking the boys on a
hike out towards the northern coast - Iriediana still blames herself,
thinking she cursed the boys with human lifespans by following their
naming traditions.

Upon leaving for his [Wanderung](wanderung "wikilink"), it is
traditional that an elf\'s parents each give him a gift to remind him of
his roots. Willannan fletched him a bronze-headed arrow, and Iriediana
gave him a doeskin bound journal - the first page of which containing a
sketch of Worsa and his brother as 40yo boys.
