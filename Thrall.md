A wild and dangerous island, Thrall is home to thousands of Trolls,
Goblinoids and Orcs. The place is utterly rife with infighting amongst
the tribes, save for one clan - led by a terrifyingly powerful [Orc
Shaman](Gul'Dan "wikilink").

Landmarks
---------

-   [Gul\'Far](Gul'Far "wikilink") - the largest war camp on the island.
-   The Warfields - the permanent battlefields across the land.
-   Ogreheim - An old settlement of Ogres on the coast, who maintain
    tentative trade links with humankind on the mainland.
