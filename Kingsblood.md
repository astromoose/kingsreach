Kingsblood is produced from grapes grown and processed in the fields and
valleys surrounding [KingsHold](KingsHold "wikilink"). The wine produced
is then fortified by the addition of a neutral grape spirit known as
aguardente in order to stop the fermentation, leaving residual sugar in
the wine, and to boost the alcohol content. The wine is then stored and
aged, often in barrels stored in caves before being bottled.

The wine\'s name comes from the tale of a coven of vampires that once
controlled the governing of the city. A group of adventurers outed and
killed them, burning their corpses down by the river Doron. It is said
that the ashes of the vampires have made the soil more fertile since -
and the leader of the adventurers once said of the vampires \"They come
here for the blood of our King, for it must taste the sweetest\".

The reaches of the valley of the Doron River have a microclimate that is
optimal for cultivation of olives, almonds, and especially grapes
important for making Kingsblood. The region is known for its picturesque
farms clinging on to almost vertical slopes dropping down to the river.
