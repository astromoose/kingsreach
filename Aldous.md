-   -   Aldous Gyre\*\*

//\"What did you see?\" The whispered voice was insistent.//
//\"Nothing; I saw nothing. Just shadows. Nothing more.\" His reply was
no more loud.// //\"Well, it\'ll come. One day. When you need it to;
when you can\'t ignore it any more.\" Soothing now, but still a promise,
one that Aldous knew he would have to fulfill\...//

Born in KingsHold to cobbler Augur Gyre and his wife, Melana, Aldous has
spent his, admittedly short, life in the City and its environs. More
skilled in the habitual talents of the halflings than the maintenance of
footwear, Aldous has been a guildsman for some time, picking the odd job
of interest here and there to fund his relatively comfortable lifestyle.

Unfortunately, his last job didn\'t run as planned.

On paper, a simple first-floor in-and-out became, in practise, a
darkened house, a maze of passages and a hastily-jemmied cellar hatch to
get back into the daylight. Oh, and //something// in the dark that made
Aldous re-think his career choices so far.

Shortly thereafter, a considerably more chastened, and mildly less
larcenous, Aldous started looking for answers from //anyone// that can
help. Initially, this was supplied by the\... //acquisition//\... of
some religious tracts, but more was needed. And this has led him to be
inducted into the Prism\...

Aldous is a guildsman in good standing of the //Cog//, a guild in
KingsHold involved mostly in safe-cracking, house-breaking and
second-storey work. He bears their tattoo on his left wrist:
