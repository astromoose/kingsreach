The twin keeps of //Honour// and //Duty// stand at the northern coast of
Amberdale, keeping watch for Pirates coming from the west and looking to
[Oakhollow](Oakhollow "wikilink") in the north.

A small standing army is spread between the two castles, made up of
soldiers from all over the country. //Honour// is currently run by Roguy
Bourne of [Scorpios](Scorpios "wikilink"), and //Duty// by Charles
Steelmas of [KingsHold](KingsHold "wikilink").
