An ancient and enormous stone portcullis, Firegate is the only known
entrance to the Dwarven stronghold nation of
[Deepforge](Deepforge "wikilink").

The way is open on precisely 8 days of every calendar year - the first
and last of every season. Small camps of traders and adventurers gather
in the preceeding week or so in a well-trod clearing at the mouth of the
fire road. This mile of paved path is lined by the steep carvedsides of
the mountain\'s mouth, and is peppered with murderholes that even in
darkest winter flames can be seen from. Two giant furnace vents burn
high on either side of the main entrance.
