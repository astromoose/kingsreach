Founder of Connor\'s Port, in southeast Caliph.

Tanned, neat and lean. Wears his oiled hair tied back with shaved sides,
and a large sapphire the size of a man\'s thumbnail in his left earlobe.
Dresses in expensive and elaborately gilded leather armour, with
intricately embossed bronze bracers.

Has a penchant for expensive and hard-to-obtain treasure, and appears to
have no qualms in hiring adventurers for crazy amounts of money to get
it.
