The City\'s militia is also the police force and personal guard to the
King. 2000 men strong, the King and his advisors have ensured the best
training for the Guard by maintaining close links with the elves of
Melthrior and the Order of the Stag.

The uniform consists of a suit of Masterwork Half-Plate, a Tower shield
and a broadsword all engraved with the King\'s seal. They have bright
blue cloaks and gold-inlaid helms.
