Introduction
============

<span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #222222; display: block; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13.200000762939453px;">The
roar of the crowd rings like a tolling bell in your ears. Sweat pours
from your brow as you circle your newest foes.</span>
<span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #222222; display: block; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13.200000762939453px;">The
blade in your hand is really the only sure thing in your life when you
step out into the Lens.</span>
<span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #222222; display: block; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13.200000762939453px;">You
have faced so many creatures over the last years of your life - inhuman,
unholy, clawed, winged, scaled, deadly and terrifying things. Each time
you are escorted up into the arena, the glaring sun reminds you that
everything outside these little moments is like dust. Each time you face
the monsters out there - your heart wakes up and you truly feel alive.
The ground can be even or mountainous, grassy or a desert sand. Once,
you had to fight completely submerged in water. You never know what you
will face, nor who you will face them with. Like the others, you have no
real name other than the one the mob shouts when you have defeated your
enemies.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #222222; display: block; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13.200000762939453px;">

<span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #222222; display: block; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13.200000762939453px;">They
call you Spatha, named for the Tain cavalry longsword you wield with
such deadly
strength.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #222222; display: block; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13.200000762939453px;">\-\--</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #222222; display: block; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13.200000762939453px;"><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #222222; display: block; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13.200000762939453px;">They
call you Crixus, named for the basketed and closed Legion helm you took
as a prize at the end of your first year in the arena. </span></span>
<span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #222222; display: block; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13.200000762939453px;">

------------------------------------------------------------------------

</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #222222; display: block; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13.200000762939453px;">The
life of a Lensman is short, drenched in blood and glory. The shining
city at the centre of it\'s Republic - Tain - is home to the Lens, a
magical arena that summons creatures to fight the champions dragged up
from the dredges of it\'s society. These orphans, criminals and
disgraced men are cut and polished into the diamonds of true warriors,
or they are smashed into the dust like so much coal. Only the hardest
survive.</span>
<span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #222222; display: block; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13.200000762939453px;">You
have no idea how old you are.</span>
<span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #222222; display: block; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13.200000762939453px;">You
have never known a family or really had friends - not counting the
fleeting truces in the heat of battle to defeat a larger beast.</span>
<span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #222222; display: block; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13.200000762939453px;">Your
home is but a small cell, the door magically locked until you are
summoned to fight. A window in the ceiling shows you a sky, 12 hours of
light and 12 hours of darkness.</span>
<span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #222222; display: block; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13.200000762939453px;">Inside,
you have exercise equipment and training weapons, and healthy food is
brought to you four times a day. Calisthenics and resistance training
has shredded your form of excess fat and left you a sharpened weapon of
a man.</span>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #222222; display: block; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13.200000762939453px;">You
are tall, lean and powerful. Your grey skin has tanned to a black sheen
in the sunlight outside. Your steel grey eyes haunt even you yourself
when you have seen your
reflection.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #222222; display: block; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13.200000762939453px;"><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #222222; display: block; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13.200000762939453px;">\-\--</span></span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #222222; display: block; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13.200000762939453px;"><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #222222; display: block; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13.200000762939453px;">Your
dusky red skin has dulled to a brown in the blazing sun of the past
year. Your powerful frame allows you to fight on your feet for what
feels like hours at a time without rest. Your green eyes are soft when
you have seen them in a reflection, your calmness shows through in your
skill at arms in battle.</span>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

</span>
<span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #222222; display: block; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13.200000762939453px;">That
morning when you took your armour (such as it is, a steel vambrace and
wide girdle) and blade from the rack outside your cell door, like every
time before it you had no idea what you would face.</span>
<span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #222222; display: block; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13.200000762939453px;">The
things before you were once men - animated skeletons armed with wicked
blades and intricate armour from a far away land. One of them hisses a
whispered word at you at it lunges for you -//GOLLLDD//. Lazily turning
it\'s blade aside you neatly step inside it\'s reach and separate it\'s
head and sword arm from the rest of it at the shoulder. More of them
come for you, there must be //dozens// of them. The ground is a soft and
marshy mess, but your bare feet quickly fall into the rhythms of
combat.</span>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #222222; display: block; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13.200000762939453px;"><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #222222; display: block; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13.200000762939453px;">There
is another Lensman in the field with you today, a tall and powerful one
the crowds call Spatha.</span>
<span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial,sans-serif;">\-\--</span>
</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #222222; display: block; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13.200000762939453px;">There
is another Lensman in the field with you today, a swarthy and stocky one
the crowds call
Crixus.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #222222; display: block; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13.200000762939453px;">
</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #222222; display: block; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13.200000762939453px;">

------------------------------------------------------------------------

</span>
<span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #222222; display: block; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13.200000762939453px;">Some
of the things starts to run towards the arena\'s edge, to a portal
there. You notice that the grated portcullis that usually bars it\'s
egress has jammed - five Legionaries are climbing down to try and
unstick it.</span>
<span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #222222; display: block; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13.200000762939453px;">Four
of the soldiers engage the undead things, as you fight your way through
the mess of them towards the gate. One of them misjudges a block,
stumbling into his neighbour\'s shield. Their iron-shod sandals are
sticking in the swampy ground, you realise. Three blades pierce one of
the soliders as you charge into range. Your fellow Lensman has run with
you. Another two soliders drop to the greater numbers of undead. The
last Legionary braces his shield and puts up a valiant defence as his
friend desperately pulls on the jammed barrier - a skull has been jammed
into the corner, you see as you close the last few metres. Some of the
skeletons are ravaging the dead bodies, shrieking //GOLLLDD// as they do
so, but some are running through the gateway.</span>
<span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #222222; display: block; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13.200000762939453px;">In
the heat of the moment, you see a chance for freedom. As your legs begin
to propel you towards the darkness, you cannot help but notice your
colleague has had the same idea - bustling through a pair of skeletons
you plunge into the
void-</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #222222; display: block; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13.200000762939453px;">

Session 1 (April 3rd 2014) {#session_1_april_3rd_2014}
==========================

<span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #222222; display: block; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13.200000762939453px;">
</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #222222; display: block; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13.200000762939453px;">The
abruptness of transition between where the two Lensmen were and where
they land shows in two places - their pupils dilate as they adjust to
the dusk of evening - and the hairs on their skin twitch as a winter\'s
chill hits them. Stumbling to a barefoot stop together, they take in the
scene before
them.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #222222; display: block; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13.200000762939453px;">
</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #222222; display: block; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13.200000762939453px;">In
the foothills of a mountain, two armies meet on loamy dirt and soil -
one of men and one of the undead. At least seven thousand skeleton
warriors clash with a smaller force of two thousand humans. The skies
are grey and cloudy, the moon shining clearly through to illuminate a
long patch of land miles away in the distance that glows in cold white
and dead grey. Even from so far away it is clear that nothing will ever
grow there again, trees and anything that once lived had been reduced to
twigs, the very soil itself burned to
ash.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #222222; display: block; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13.200000762939453px;">
</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #222222; display: block; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13.200000762939453px;">The
men wear their hair and beards long, and their skin is pink and pale to
the eyes of the Lensmen. They wield heavy swords and shields, and are
clad in hide and leather armours with shirts of chain link underneath.
Their style of warfare is immediately interesting but woefully amusing
to Crixus and Spatha, who have perfected so many ways to kill monsters
and men over their years in the arena. They know that the legions of
their homeland would crush both sides of this battle with half their
combined numbers, but all these thoughts are quickly swept aside. Seeing
a tall pink-skinned man surrounded by banner men, the pair begin to
fight their way towards
him.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #222222; display: block; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13.200000762939453px;">
</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #222222; display: block; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13.200000762939453px;">Smashing
and cutting through the seething skeletons, they see on the hills above
a skeletal dragon fighting against two strange figures - a stumpy one in
shining metal armour and a short lithe one in dark garb firing arrows
from an elegant longbow. The stumpy one throws it\'s battle-axe at the
beast, seeming to wound
it.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #222222; display: block; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13.200000762939453px;">
</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #222222; display: block; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13.200000762939453px;">A
cry of despair comes from the skeleton army\'s side as the Dracolich
flies away - mirrored by a roaring cheer that lets up from the human men
- the undead are failing and in some cases fall down on the spot in
piles of bones and
armour.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #222222; display: block; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13.200000762939453px;">
</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #222222; display: block; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13.200000762939453px;">In
the aftermath, the pink skinned men surround Spatha and Crixus - before
the tall leader of their army comes to meet them. They hear muttering
amongst the men, in a tongue that sounds dirty and inefficient. However,
in a stroke of luck the leader speaks out to them - greeting them in a
clean and totally accent-less example of their own language. Not giving
up their blades but coming quietly, the Lensmen allow themselves to be
taken up onto stocky horses to be ridden back to a crudely walled camp a
few miles
away.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #222222; display: block; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13.200000762939453px;">
</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #222222; display: block; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13.200000762939453px;">Over
a simple dinner of roasted meat and vegetables, the leader introduces
himself as Lord Willard Eskiath, first of his house. He and another
noble house, named Rounden had raised an army after the Dracolich
they\'d seen before had been terrorising the country for the previous
decade. In doing so, he gave the pair name for the strange cold land
they had landed in - [Eichvall](Oakhollow "wikilink"). Willard told the
tale of the dragon as they shared meat, bread and rough-tasting red wine
together. He explained that he and all nobles of the Glades learned this
tongue when they were young to read the legends and journals of their
past. He suspected that somewhere in the distant past, the Lensmen and
the people of the Eich shared common
lineage.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #222222; display: block; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13.200000762939453px;">
</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #222222; display: block; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13.200000762939453px;">Just
as the land of Eichvall had not always been swamp and mud, this
[Scathe](Scathe "wikilink") had not always been undead. Having long
passed into legend, she had slept for well over four centuries before
awakening with a renewed hunger for treasure and gold. Coveting gold
above all, she quickly turned to attacking the rich castles and cities
of the land. For years, the men of the glades had fought her off with
their greatest heroes and siege weapons, and as the injuries piled up
the dragon grew sick in her old age - and she started to seek out ways
to lengthen her life. Turning to magic was no great challenge for an
ancient dragon\'s intellect, and searching her hoard she came across
some terrible and truly evil Fel Necromancy. It was this Fel knowledge
that augmented her breath, bringing about the massive loss of life that
the people named the \'Cry of Wrath\'. They named it so because in the
green-black fires that followed, the grim screams of the dying were
amplified so loud that they moved the clouds in the skies. Scathe turned
the souls of the dying into fuel for her undeath, becoming a Lich
forevermore.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #222222; display: block; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13.200000762939453px;">
</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #222222; display: block; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13.200000762939453px;">As
her quest for more and more treasure grew, she summoned the dead as
skeletons to seek out and count the gold pieces left lying in the
scarred land - and before long she started to send them further afield.
The Glades formed up their armies and went to war in answer. House
Pentash was betrayed by one of their most skilled wizards, Azalin - who
also sought the power of undeath for himself. In giving up the treasures
under the Foxcastle, he gained himself a dangerous ally in Scathe. They
plotted to cast another Cry of Wrath - one that was foiled by Eskiath
and his
army.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #222222; display: block; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13.200000762939453px;">
</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #222222; display: block; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13.200000762939453px;">This
night would have been a third attempt, were it not for the storm and the
sudden appearance of these dark warriors in their midst. Eskiath
explained that the stunty one - the //female// dwarf named Vareschick
had wounded Scathe enough for her to flee. Azalin had panicked and fled
back to his Mallowfort, north of The Dead Scar that glowed near the
horizon from the
camp.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #222222; display: block; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13.200000762939453px;">
</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #222222; display: block; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13.200000762939453px;">Eskiath
said he was going after Azalin, and the stranger\'s blades would be most
welcome at his side. Deciding that they\'d bought him a little luck, he
was sure they could bring him a little more as they spoke of seeking
glory at his
side.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #222222; display: block; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13.200000762939453px;">
</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #222222; display: block; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13.200000762939453px;">Eventually
laying their heads to rest on scratchy horse blankets in a pungent tent,
the Lensmen tried to sleep under a foreign sky - free for the first time
in their
lives.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #222222; display: block; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13.200000762939453px;">
</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #222222; display: block; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13.200000762939453px;">
