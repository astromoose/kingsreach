A strong and wonderful Dwarven Whisky.

COLOUR
------

Gilded lily.

NOSE
----

Opening with assertive waves of peat smoke and coastal squall, the
olfactory system is on high alert in anticipation of some major sensory
excitement. A swell of aromatics flood the senses with notes of iodine,
salty canvas, crushed sea shells, charred oak staves, black pepper,
paprika and leather tobacco pouches. The second wave brings vanilla,
figs and soft plump dates, marinated pear, freshly milled malt, dark
sweet toffee and cracked walnuts. It's smoky. It's smouldering. It's
sensuous. Just close your eyes and inhale long and deep. This is
aromatic awesomeness.

PALATE
------

Waves of the sweetest, smoothest, warmest smokiest spirit that you have
ever experienced flood onto the palate like the atlantic surf on
Honor&Duty\'s bay. It is potent, focused and the flavours explode
brilliantly onto the palate. Full of depth and complexity, the smokey
sweetness of the barley contrasts beautifully with the marine freshness
of the spirit and the richness of toffee and vanilla. The complexity is
enhanced further with a citrus twist and then mellow oak tempers the
fire. Once the taste buds adjust to what is happening, they rejoice in
the company and pleasure of this young dwarven spirit.

FINISH
------

Long and heart-warming, arousing feelings of pride and passion. It
brings courage and strength, honesty and faith to your very soul.

MOOD
----

It cries "freedom". You are in a good place and you envy no man. You
feel alive and ready for whatever lies ahead, knowing that the true
spirit of the mountain is with you.
