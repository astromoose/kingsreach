Melthrior is the elven word for //10 centuries//. Home to the High Elves
of Amberdale. Sat atop a ridge in the high hills of the plains, it is a
small walled city of ancient and considerable beauty. The elves have
bred seldom over the past centuries, as tradition demands that the
population stays at a steady 1000. At the moment there are 34 elves away
on [wanderung](wanderung "wikilink") - one of which is named
[Worza](Worza "wikilink").

Landmarks
---------

-   \*\*The White Halls\*\* - some of the eldest elves alive convene
    here and share their wisdom of ages.
-   \*\*Elder Library\*\* - the largest collection of literature, art
    and maps on the continent.
-   \*\*House of Stags\*\* - a place of martial learning, and home to

Traditions
----------

-   \*\*Matrimony\*\* - When two elves marry in Melchior, the bride
    takes the groom\'s family name. Since elves are effectively
    immortal, relationships tend to wax and wane with the centuries.
    When women re-marry, they take their new husband\'s family name in
    addition to their other family names - For example, //Alyssa
    Dawnsong Lio Purslane// has been married twice - once into the
    family //Lio// and once into the family //Purslane//.
-   \*\*Class\*\* - Social class is nonexistent, all professions and
    undertakings are considered equal in time. Elves choose their own
    paths, and respect each others.
-   \*\*Melthrior\*\* - The name of the city itself dictates how many
    elves live there at one time. When an elf dies, after a mourning
    period of one calendar year - an elven family can claim the right to
    have a child.
