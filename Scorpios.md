-   -   Scorpios\*\* is the second largest settlement in Ambervale, a
        walled city stood near to an ancient ruined city. The [Order of
        Thoth](Order_of_Thoth "wikilink") are based here, as are the
        largest schools of Magic in the country. The city keeps a small
        standing army to fend off Orc/Goblinoid raids from
        [Thrall](Thrall "wikilink") in the west, although these have
        been few and far between over the past 40 years.

The city is divided into eleven wards, 9 for the schools of magic and
three for the local militia, mercantile and ruling classes. Each ward
houses a school of magic, including dorm houses for students. The 60ft,
magically built dark marbled walls surrounding the city have towers and
parapets, and look like pretty hard work to scale. The river\'s water is
//strikingly// clear and blue, flowing from the eastern underwater
caverns of slate and granite. Judging by the marshy land to the west of
the city, many speculate as to how much magic has been used to
strengthen the foundations of the wards.

Each of the bridges connecting the parts of the city have small guard
posts at either end. The guards are practicing warrior mages, and upon
entry to the city they offer to cast monitoring spells on newcomer\'s
weaponry or take it into care until they leave.
